START
Create Snack type variables and those variables will have the name of the snack and give each variable its number (e.g Lays, Cheetos) (Snack is a user-defined structure with members integer type snack_code , available_snacks =10, total_snacks=10 and float price)
Create bool money
Print “Welcome Please input the money for the snacks”
Read money_input
If money is not valid
Print “Invalid amount”
Give back money_input
If the money_input is valid
Create integer type array arr[42]
Read the dialled number and store it in array arr until “ok” is pressed
If that number/s exists 
Then check, if there is more than one snack
Add all the prices and store in integer type total price.
End if
Else if there is only one snack 
Then that snack’s price = total price.
End else if
Else that number doesn’t exist.
Then print “enter the valid number”
go to step 4.
End else
If that money input >= total amount.
Integer type money_output = money_input
Create for loop with int i=0 and will repeat until i<=size of arr.
if the available_snack of that number/s >0 
Decrement the available_snacks of that number
Rotate metal spirals of that particular number until the item is dropped
Stop rotation
End while loop
money_output = money_input – total_amount
Increment I
End if
Else
Print “(snack name) is not available”
End for loop
Give money_output
End if
Go to step 4
Else money input != total amount 
Print “Insufficient amount for snacks”
Give back the money_input
End else
END
